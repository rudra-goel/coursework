INFO (XSTRM-427): Based on current hardware configuration, running XStream Out translation in multi-threaded mode with 4 threads.
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

INFO (XSTRM-180): You have not used the '-objectMap' option. The design has instance(s) of at least one of following OpenAccess objects: oaBlockage, oaBoundary, oaRow, and oaMarker. Any information about these objects will not be translated into the generated stream file. Use the '-objectMap' option to translate/preserve these objects using XStream.
WARNING (XSTRM-35): The objects in the layer-purpose pair 'nwell:drawing' are ignored. This is because the layer-purpose pair used in the design is not specified in the layer map file. Specify the layer-purpose pair in the layer map file and try again.
WARNING (XSTRM-35): The objects in the layer-purpose pair 'pwell:drawing' are ignored. This is because the layer-purpose pair used in the design is not specified in the layer map file. Specify the layer-purpose pair in the layer map file and try again.
WARNING (XSTRM-35): The objects in the layer-purpose pair 'metal1:drawing' are ignored. This is because the layer-purpose pair used in the design is not specified in the layer map file. Specify the layer-purpose pair in the layer map file and try again.
WARNING (XSTRM-35): The objects in the layer-purpose pair 'pimplant:drawing' are ignored. This is because the layer-purpose pair used in the design is not specified in the layer map file. Specify the layer-purpose pair in the layer map file and try again.

INFO (XSTRM-223): 1. Translating cellview project_3/full_adder_1_bit_new_layout/layout as STRUCTURE full_adder_1_bit_new_layout.
WARNING (XSTRM-399): The STRUCT 'full_adder_1_bit_new_layout' generated for 'project_3/full_adder_1_bit_new_layout/layout' in GDS is empty because either the design is empty or no shape or object was translated.
